# What does the app do?

The application is based on creating **"help-request posts"**. Such a post includes information such as a** description of the problem, location, emergency level**, or even data about whether **we are willing to pay** the helper a small salary. After creating such a inquiry, it's visible to the other users. The posts are divided into** different sections** - from the **closest**, to the most **recent** ones. When we create such a request, other users can** declare their support**. After doing it, help-declared posts are displayed in a separate section. People who reported their willingness to help **may call the person in need** - their phone number is visible (but only for people who declared help). When the help request has been done or there are enough people willing to participate in it, **the author may mark it as completed**. Then it will disappear from the general notice board and move to a separate section - both for the author and the "helpers".
